# Numerical-Methods-Solution-and-Error-Plots
This repository contains numerical solution and error plots for the one-dimensional linear advection equation. Figures show solution evolution and discrete error norms for FTCS, first-order upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, and Lax-Wendroff schemes. Results cover smooth and non-smooth initial conditions under periodic boundaries.
